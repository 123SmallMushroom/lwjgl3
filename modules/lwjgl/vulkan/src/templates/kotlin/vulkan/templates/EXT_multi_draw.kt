        Processing multiple draw commands in sequence incurs measurable overhead within drivers due to repeated state checks and updates during dispatch. This extension enables passing the entire sequence of draws directly to the driver in order to avoid any such overhead, using an array of ##VkMultiDrawInfoEXT or ##VkMultiDrawIndexedInfoEXT structs with {@code vkCmdDrawMultiEXT} or {@code vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT}, respectively. These functions could be used any time multiple draw commands are being recorded without any state changes between them in order to maximize performance.

        <h5>C Specification</h5>
        To record an ordered sequence of drawing operations which have no state changes between them, call:

        <pre><code>
￿void vkCmdDrawMultiEXT(
￿    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,

        <h5>C Specification</h5>
        To record an ordered sequence of indexed drawing operations which have no state changes between them, call:

        <pre><code>
￿void vkCmdDrawMultiIndexedEXT(
￿    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,

        <h5>Description</h5>
        {@code drawCount} indexed draws are executed with parameters taken from {@code pIndexInfo}. The number of draw commands recorded is {@code drawCount}, with each command reading, sequentially, a {@code firstIndex} and an {@code indexCount} from {@code pIndexInfo}. If {@code pVertexOffset} is {@code NULL}, a {@code vertexOffset} is also read from {@code pIndexInfo}, otherwise the value from dereferencing {@code pVertexOffset} is used.
