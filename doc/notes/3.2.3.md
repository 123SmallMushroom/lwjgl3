### 3.2.3

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [Shaderc](https://github.com/google/shaderc) bindings. (#77)
- glfw: Updated to 3.4.0 pre-release (up from 3.3.0):
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.1.109 (up from 1.0.107)
    * Includes MoltenVK 1.0.35

#### Improvements

- Core: Added relative & absolute `apply(Consumer<T>)` methods to `StructBuffer<T>`. 

#### Fixes

- EGL/GLES: Fixed bootstrapping code.
    * Regression caused by `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` refactoring in `3.2.2`.

#### Breaking Changes

```
(B): binary incompatible change
(S): source incompatible change
```

- Vulkan: The `descriptorCount` member of `VkWriteDescriptorSet` must now be set explicitly. **(S)**
    * The semantics of `descriptorCount` may change via extensions, which invalidates auto-sizing.
