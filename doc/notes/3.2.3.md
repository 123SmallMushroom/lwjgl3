### 3.2.3

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [Shaderc](https://github.com/google/shaderc) bindings. (#77)
- glfw: Updated to 3.4.0 pre-release (up from 3.3.0):
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.1.109 (up from 1.0.107)
    * Includes MoltenVK 1.0.35

#### Improvements

- Linux: Added support for ARM builds.
    * 32-bit: ARMv7/armhf architecture. Maven classifier: `linux-arm32`
    * 64-bit: ARMv8/AArch64 architecture. Maven classifier: `linux-arm64`
- Windows: There is now a separate native JAR file per architecture.
    * The default contains x64 shared libraries only. Maven classifier: `windows`
    * `lwjgl-natives-windows-x86.jar` contains x86 shared libraries only. Maven classifier: `windows-x86`
    * The `32` suffix has been dropped from x86 shared library names.
- Refactored the layout of native JAR files.
    * Shared libraries have been moved from the root to a `<platform>/<arch>/<module>/` subfolder.
    * `<platform>`: one of `linux`, `macos`, `windows`.
    * `<arch>`: one of `x64`, `x86`, `arm64`, `arm32`.
    * `<module>`: name of the Java module to which the native JAR file belongs.
    * The new layout allows multiple native JAR files to be combined for custom deployment.
    * Custom (or the old) layout may be used with newly exposed `Configuration` options.
- Core: Added `enum Platform.Architecture` and `Platform.getArchitecture()` API.
- Core: Added relative & absolute `apply(Consumer<T>)` methods to `StructBuffer<T>`. 
- Core: Added `Consumer<T>` setters to structs with nested arrays of structs.
- Core: Added `memByteBuffer` overloads that return `ByteBuffer` views of other buffer types.

#### Fixes

- EGL/GLES: Fixed bootstrapping code.
    * Regression caused by `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` refactoring in `3.2.2`.
- OpenGL: Fixed signatures of `glGetnUniformiv` and `glGetnUniformuiv`.

#### Breaking Changes

```
(B): binary incompatible change
(S): source incompatible change
```

- Core: The `Library.loadSystem` & `Library.loadNative` methods now require a module name parameter. **(S)**
- Core: Removed `Consumer<T>` overloads from read-only structs with nested struct members. **(S)**
- Vulkan: The `descriptorCount` member of `VkWriteDescriptorSet` must now be set explicitly. **(S)**
    * The semantics of `descriptorCount` may change via extensions, which invalidates auto-sizing.
