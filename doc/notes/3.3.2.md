#### Improvements

- Windows: Shared libraries are now built with Visual Studio 2022 (up from 2019)
- Core: Added support for JDK 19 (#799)
- Core: Added `MemoryUtil::memByteBuffer(Struct)`. It creates a `ByteBuffer` view of a struct value.
- Core: More `SharedLibraryLoader` improvements. (#790)
  * The default `Configuration.SHARED_LIBRARY_EXTRACT_DIRECTORY` is now `lwjgl_<trimmed_user_name>`.
  * The default `Configuration.SHARED_LIBRARY_EXTRACT_PATH` now includes the CPU architecture. (`<temp_root>/<extract_dir>/<version>/<arch>/`)
  * Added `Configuration.SHARED_LIBRARY_EXTRACT_FORCE`.
- Core: The string returned by `Version::getVersion()` now follows the Java version format (`M.m.r+B` or `M.m.r-snapshot+B`).
- The `.sha1` and `.git` files, used for validating LWJGL artifacts, are now stored under the `META-INF` folder.
- Remotery: Made it easier to get started with Remotery profiling: (#784)
  * Users can now identify the commit used to build the Remotery bindings in the `Remotery` class javadoc.
  * A script that quickly clones the Remotery repository at that commit is also included.
    The viewer application at `vis/index.html` is guaranteed to be compatible with the LWJGL bindings. 
  * Ported two simple Remotery samples (`modules/samples/src/test/java/org/lwjgl/demo/util/remotery/`).

#### Fixes

- Core: Fixed Java/native library incompatibility detection. (#737)
- Core: Fixed `dlerror` decoding to use UTF-8. (#738)
- Core: Fixed `Version::getVersion()` when LWJGL is in the module path. (#770)
- Build: Fixed offline mode with multiple local architectures. (#740)
- NanoSVG: Fixed auto-sizing of `NSVGPath::pts` buffer.
- Opus: Fixed `pcm` parameter type of `opus_decode_float` function. (#785)
- Remotery: Fixed `rmtSettings::free` callback signature.
- Vulkan: Fixed definition of the `VK_API_VERSION_PATCH` macro. (#743)
- Vulkan: Fixed `EXT_debug_utils` function dispatch. (#755)

#### Breaking Changes

- NanoVG: The `freeData` parameters of `nvgCreateFontMem*` functions are now mapped to Java `boolean`.
